# Clean Code with Dart

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the book *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin, implemented in Dart. It serves as a collection of practical examples for applying clean code principles to Dart programming. The exercises are organized by season, and each season folder contains individual problems, showcasing best practices like code readability, simplicity, and maintainability. 

To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine and explore the exercises for each season. You can run the Dart code directly after setting up your Dart environment. If there are tests for the exercises, they can be run using the Dart test package.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a season from the Clean Code book:

- `season-10/`: Contains exercises from season 10.
- `season-11/`: Contains exercises from season 11.
- And so on...

Each folder contains subfolders for individual exercises.
